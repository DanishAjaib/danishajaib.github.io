## About Me

Versatile individual with experience in exploratory data analysis, data visualization, hypothesis testing, logistic regression, and machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and decision trees. Excellent understanding and proficiency of platforms for effective data analysis, cleaning, and visualization, including spreadsheets, Python, Tableau, and SQL. Strong communication, organizational, and analytical skills. 
Recently completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificateâ€”a rigorous, hands-on program that covers the entire scope of the data analysis and data modeling process.. My educational foundation includes a Master's degree in Data Science from Macquarie University. I am actively seeking entry-level Data Scientist roles where I can further apply and expand my skills.
